 tt is a utility written to measure the running time of an application. One of the main aim is to
launch the application serially selected number times. For each run, it is possible to save a separate
execution time. For the entire series the maximum and minimum time, average time, variance and standard
deviation are calculated. It is possible to specify command line options also for the application  using OPTS_DELIMITER parameter. By default it is '@', but can be changed to any other desirable symbol during configuration.
To calculate the mean and variance, to avoid overflow, the algorithms of the moving average and Welford
variance are used.
In fact, tt allows to make a mini statistical experiment.
Time is measured using 7 standard functions: clock_gettime, time, clock, gettimeofday, timespec_get,
times, getrusage. Thus, on the other hand, the tt utility can be viewed as observation and comparison
the behavior of the listed functions for the selected application.
If _POSIX_TIMERS is defined, then for clock_gettime function, the utility selects CLOCK with
lowest available resolution.
To launch the application, there is a choice between the fork/exec and posix_spawn mechanisms.
It is possible to save intermediate results either in the utility stack and in the heap, for this utility
must be compiled with different keys.
There is an opportunity to hide the output of the application itself and to hide individual execution times. 
It is also possible not to save intermediate results.
There is a possibility to write to the file.
For greater accuracy, it is possible to specify a sleeping time between individual launches.
tt can show resolution for some clocks and size limits for some types.
Handled stack and heap overflow: SIGBUS, SIGSEGV signals.
