DESCRIPTION

Main aim of *tt* is to run chosen *application* serially, several times
and measure running time.  For this *application* is given by absolute
_path_ using option ’-b’ and _amount_ of repeatings is given by option
’-c’.  For each run, it is possible to save a separate execution time.
For the entire series the maximum and minimum time, average time,
variance and standard deviation are calculated.  Time is measured using
7 standard functions: clock_gettime, time, clock, gettimeofday,
timespec_get, times, getrusage.  If defined _POSIX_TIMERS, then tt for
clock_gettime function selects CLOCK with lowest available resolution in
first place.

SYNOPSIS

   tt [-arqgtomspHfM] [-S seconds] [-b path [@ application options @] ]
[-c amount]

   tt [-R] [-d ] [-R] [-V ] [-h]

OPTIONS

   ‘-a’ for second clock_gettime selects CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID.

   ‘-r’ includes function getrusage.

   ‘-q’ quiet - hides standard output for application.

   ‘-g’ includes function gettimeofday.

   ‘-t’ includes function times.

   ‘-o’ includes function clock.

   ‘-m’ includes function time.

   ‘-s’ includes function timespec_get.

   ‘-p’ force posix_spawn to run application, by default is used
fork/exec.

   ‘-H’ hide intermediate results for each, application run, implies -M.

   ‘-f’ prints to file “tt_results.txt” in current directory.

   ‘-M’ not keep intermediate results

   ‘-S’ seconds sleep seconds between each iteration.

   ‘-b’ path absolute path for *application*.  It is possible to specify
command line options also for the *application* using OPTS_DELIMITER
parameter.  By default it is ’@’, but can be changed to any other
desirable symbol during configuration.  For example: ./configure
OPTS_DELIM="\&".  Also can be used OPTS_DELIM=’\&’ or OPTS_DELIM=\’\&\’
forms.  See examples.

   ‘-c’ amount run *application* amount times.

   ‘-R’ show resolution for some clocks.

   ‘-d’ show size limits for some types.

   ‘-V’ Version.

   ‘-h’ help.

OTHER

It is possible to save intermediate results either in the tt stack or in
the heap.  By default tt use stack.  For heap, before compiling, it
should be configured with option –enable-MEMORY. Source is prepared for
translation using gettext.  For translation .mo files can be chosen
directory by using variable LDIR during configuration.  For example:
./configure LDIR=/home/user/tt/po/ , if not defined "/usr/share/locale"
will be used.

EXAMPLES

   tt -b /usr/bin/find -c 30 -q -a -S 1 -m -t -g -r -s -o

runs *application* find in current directory 30 times, hide standard
output for it, use second clock_gettime, time, times, gettimeofday,
getrusage, timespec_get and clock functionsfor measuring time.  Sleep 1
second between each run.

   tt -b /bin/ls @-l -h@ -c 100 -q -a -S 2 -m -t -g -r -s -o

runs *application* ls in current directory 100 times with options "-l
-h", hide standard output for it, use second clock_gettime, time, times,
gettimeofday, getrusage, timespec_get and clock functions for measuring
time.  Sleep 2 seconds between each run.  As mentioned, it can be used
other symbol in place of ’@’.  If, for example, ’&’ is chosen, then it
should be used with escape symbol:

   tt -b /bin/ls \&-l -h\& -c 100 -q -a -S 2 -m -t -g -r -s -o
